What is Firmware?
Firmware act as a translator, it converts logic and algorithms into electrical signals
How?
Intialization: It sets up the CPU clock, configure pins(Input and output), and wakes u p peripherals
Hardware Control: It manages the flow of electron through transistors to toggle pins or read voltages.
Resource Management: It ensures that limited RAM and CPU cycles are used efficiently to maintain real time performance 
What is Firmware Libraries and APIs?
Firmware Library is a collection of pre-written codes that handels common tasks.
API(Application Program Interface) is the "menu" of functions in the Firmware library.
Microcontrollers have thousands of 32 bit registers. Manually tracking each to control timer clock is prone to error, so we need Libraries that provides Abstraction Layer (often called as Hardware Abstraction Layer HAL) that maps human-readable names to complex memory address.
Why functions like digitalWrite(), delay(), Serial.write() exist?
E.g -> To Turn ON LED, Microcontroller need to change specific bits in specific Register, without API we would have to write *(volatile uint32_t  *)0x40021018 |= (1 << 5) and with API it is digitalWrite(13, High);
Why reusable APIs are critical?
If SoCs or chip is changed (e.g from STMicroelectronis to Texas Instruments) then a well designed APIs allow engineers to port their code quickly without rewriting the entire logic from scratch.
What is Bare-Metal Firmware?
Bare-Metal means the code is running directly on hardware without an Operating System or Real Time Operating System (RTOS) sitting in between.
Why No RTOS is Used?
In many simple programs like thermometer or a remote control, RTOS add unnecessary overhead. An RTOS consumes RAM and CPU cycles to manage tasks, if program do only one or two things then bare-metal is faster, smaller and deterministic.
Handling Tasks without OS?
Without an OS to schedule a task, bare-metal firmware relies on three main concepts:
The Super Loop (polling): The code runs in a infinite loop i.e while(1), bascially it checks if button is pressed for the action to be executed, acts on it and moves to the next line.
Interrupts: This are "hardware triggered" events. If critical signal arrives, hardware pauses the main loop instantly and runs a small function called "Interrupt Service Routine" (ISR) and then returns to where it left off.
Hardware Timers: Instead of an OS clock, the firmware configures hardware counter to trigger events at precise intervals
